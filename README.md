# Ableton.spoon

This is similar to my Reason.spoon extension, but a lot less extensive
because Ableton has better keyboard support

The most interesting thing in here is the custom Python remote script,
which is used for the create device menu. It uses the very undocumented
Ableton remote API to facilitate creating devices with a Hammerspoon chooser.
It works at the moment but is pretty unstable.

I referenced [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC)
and [Killamix_Mini](https://github.com/jefffm/Killamix_Mini)
pretty extensively while building this, check those projects out.
